# Practice-Machine-learning
The Course Project is an important component of this course and most of the other courses in the Data Science Specialization. Course Projects are usually evaluated and graded through peer assessment. You must submit your Course Project by the specified deadline to receive credit for your submission. Course Project deadlines are not flexible, and you may not apply Late Days to Course Projects.
